One of America’s greatest politicians, most respected and beloved personalities, 

Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.

Lincoln’s story is a remarkable one. Born into a humble family with illiterate parents, 

he got from being a shopkeeper to holding the highest office. While being president, 

Lincoln led his people through the Civil War, the costliest war in the history of the U.S.,

 and made major decisions on the Union war strategy. He fought for equal rights, liberty, 

 and democracy. Those hard and bloody times led to the abolition of slavery and made the economy 

 flourish. Switching to merrier times, Abraham Lincoln was also the one to establish 

 Thanksgiving as a national holiday. That big turkey wouldn’t have had the same appeal without 

 Thanksgiving, would it? From a great man of significant accomplishments, 

 a big heart with a bigger voice, we’ve handpicked a few sayings to make you cherish honor and 
 
 become a better person.
